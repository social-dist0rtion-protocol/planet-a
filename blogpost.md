# Social Dist0rtion Protocol
## The game
The social dist0rtion protocol is a blockchain game on ethereum plasma to simulate an sustainable economy in the time of exploding CO2 release.
Our hypothesis is that this simulation gives new insights how to solve the Tragedy of co2mmons with the help of blockchain.

## The story
Hi I am Sidra and part of the Social Dist0rtion Organisation. It is 2045 currently we are trying to terraform Mars while the last beautiful InstaSpots on earth are being destroyed by huge wild fires. Amsterdam Central just finished the last underwater train terminal (side note BER will be finished soon - Lilium flyers now have access to the Baltic Sea Airport Lounge). 

We decide to come back in time and play a little game with you filthy bastards who gambled with our little angry planet for power, fame, currency and beer. 

2025 corporates took over the world and decided to provide healthy competition and implemented six corporate states: called *United Kingdom of Heatwave*,  *Tornayda*, *Pollutistan*, *Cataclysmia*, *New Smogland* and *Democratic Replublic of Deforestation*.  

To claim your exclusive citizenship and corporation scan at the beginning of CCCamp2019 your *registration QR* which will give you full *access to* the corporates *funds* (3 Göllars).

Corporates of those two states are in need to grow further and make awesome deals whatever it takes. So they decided *to do big projects (handshakes)* which will produce huge profits (0.2 Göllars) and just *produce a negligible amount of CO2.* Just run around scan each others QR codes and get filthy rich.

To be rich in a corporate world doesn’t help if you don’t show your wealth and status. Therefor we provide you decent malls to buy ultra healthy liquids and high end anti aging tech. *Consuming will produce a bit more of CO2* but - hej you work so hard you earned it!

* Glow stick 1 Göllar
* Shot 2 Göllars
* Popcorn 3 Göllars
* Set free CO2 eating bacteria that destroys 2 Giga Tons of CO2 - 2 Göllars

No matter you left church or not judgement day will come and punish the ones who didn’t consume in the early good cheap days. As soon the *CO2 levels rise above 1.5%* people will vote for taxes that will *make it more expensive to buy* and consume your precious goodies. 

The Social Dist0rtion Organisation wouldn’t have send me if we wouldn’t have seen a glimpse of hope. We want to enable the community to consume reasonable and not force us to terraform Mars to survive. We set up a protocol that *incentivizes members to lower the CO2*. This will keep the *consumption at a tolerable level* and goods at an *affordable price*.  Instead of consuming Popcorn, alcohol and glow sticks you can *spend your Göllars on trees* and other CO2 binding activities. It will also help to provide shadow produce O2 and bind water in our soil to stop massive rain falls and drought.

In case you love graphs you can see which corporates are the heaviest CO2 producers. You can also see how close we get to the 2% threshold.   

## How to play:
1. Scan your passport to fill up wallet.
2. Do Handshakes to produce more Göllars.
3. Consume goods or help to reduce CO2 and save the world.
4. Slow down the CO2 production.

## Goal:
Keep the CO2 level and find a mode of consumption that helps to reduce CO2 release.

Have fun saving us
